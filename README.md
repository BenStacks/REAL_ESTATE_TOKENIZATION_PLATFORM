# Real Estate Tokenization Smart Contract

## Overview

This smart contract implements a basic Real Estate Tokenization Platform on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity programming language. It allows for the tokenization of real estate properties, enabling fractional ownership and trading of property tokens.

## Features

- Add new properties to the platform
- Tokenize existing properties
- Purchase property tokens
- View property and token details

## Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity language knowledge
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) for local development and testing

## Contract Structure

The smart contract consists of the following main components:

1. **Constants and Data Variables**
   - `contract-owner`: The address that deployed the contract
   - `total-properties`: Keeps track of the total number of properties on the platform

2. **Data Maps**
   - `properties`: Stores information about each property
   - `property-tokens`: Tracks token information for tokenized properties

3. **Non-Fungible Token**
   - `property-token`: Represents ownership of property tokens

4. **Public Functions**
   - `add-property`: Adds a new property to the platform
   - `tokenize-property`: Tokenizes an existing property
   - `buy-tokens`: Allows users to purchase property tokens

5. **Read-Only Functions**
   - `get-property`: Retrieves property details
   - `get-property-tokens`: Retrieves token details for a property

## Setup and Deployment

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-tokenization.git
   cd real-estate-tokenization
   ```

2. Install Clarinet if you haven't already:
   ```
   curl -L https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/download/v1.0.0/clarinet-linux-x64-glibc.tar.gz | tar xz
   sudo mv clarinet /usr/local/bin
   ```

3. Initialize a new Clarinet project:
   ```
   clarinet new
   ```

4. Replace the generated contract file with the provided Real Estate Tokenization Contract.

5. Deploy the contract to the Stacks testnet or mainnet using Clarinet or the Stacks CLI.

## Usage

### Adding a Property

To add a new property to the platform:

```clarity
(contract-call? .real-estate-tokenization-contract add-property u100000 "123 Main St")
```

This function can only be called by the contract owner.

### Tokenizing a Property

To tokenize an existing property:

```clarity
(contract-call? .real-estate-tokenization-contract tokenize-property u0 u1000)
```

This function can only be called by the property owner.

### Buying Tokens

To purchase tokens for a tokenized property:

```clarity
(contract-call? .real-estate-tokenization-contract buy-tokens u0 u100)
```

This function can be called by any user with sufficient STX balance.

### Viewing Property Details

To view details of a specific property:

```clarity
(contract-call? .real-estate-tokenization-contract get-property u0)
```

### Viewing Token Details

To view token details for a specific property:

```clarity
(contract-call? .real-estate-tokenization-contract get-property-tokens u0)
```

## Testing

A set of basic test cases is provided in the `real-estate-tokenization-tests.clar` file. To run the tests:

1. Deploy the main contract to a local Clarinet console.
2. Update the `contract-address` in the test file.
3. Run the test contract in the Clarinet console.

For more comprehensive testing, consider adding additional test cases and using Clarinet's testing framework.

## Security Considerations

- This contract is a basic implementation and may not be suitable for production use without further security audits and enhancements.
- Ensure proper access control mechanisms are in place before deploying to a live network.
- Consider implementing additional features such as token transfers, dividend distribution, and upgradability mechanisms.
